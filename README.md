Game of Life
==================

The Game of Life probably isn't what you think, it's a program that simulates how cells might grow or die based on a small set of rules. It was created by a British mathematician named John Conway and is sometimes called "Conway's Game of Life". John Conway was a very gifted Mathematician and universally admired for his unvarnished opinions. He unfortunately passed away April 11th 2020 due to complication with COVID - a tremendous loss to all of us. The following description and the image above are from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):

>Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:  
>
>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.   
>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.   
>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.   
>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.   
>
>These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:  
>
>1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.   
>2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.   
>3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
